        <p>The core learning objectives and exercises this week including reading several pages outlining the use of the
            localStorage browser API. We created <a href="code-samples/story_editor.html">a simple read / write system
                for short stories</a> using LocalStorage to persist the user's writing on their own browser.</p>

        <p>Another learning objective involved videos for mobile-first user experience development and how, by thinking
            about mobile development early in the plamning stages, we can distill the critical functionality and/or
            content that the user should interact with. I enjoyed listening to a podcast this week where the host
            described using a website on mobile where critical buttons were not visible on his mobile device unless he
            turned it sideways for landscape mode to activate a responsive breakpoint. Increasingly, users are enjoying
            the content of the web through the mobile platform so we would be alienating a large population by failing
            to account for mobile users.</p>
