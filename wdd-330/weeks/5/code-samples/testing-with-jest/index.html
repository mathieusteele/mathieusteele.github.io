        <p>This week I experimented with the <a href="https://jestjs.io/">JEST</a> testing framework. The file I worked
            on is here: <a href="./squareroot.test.js">squareroot.test.js</a>.

        </p>
        <p>
            To learn how it works, you'll need to install JEST (it can be installed globally using npm with the
            following command: <br />
        <pre>npm install -g jest</pre>

        Download the linked JavaScript file above and navigate in your
        command line software to the folder where you saved it. You can run the tests by typing<br />
        <pre>jest -c {}</pre>
        and it will run the tests and give you a summary of the test panel to show whether the tests passed or not. Very
        helpful particularly when refactoring code to make sure that the primary use-cases and edge cases are all
        handled in the expected way. Some people write tests before they write a function and then they can keep
        adjusting the function until all of the tests pass. This is something I have not yet tried but I look forward to
        trying.
