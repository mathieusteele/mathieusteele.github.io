        <p>
            We (group work) made a super cool <a href="./code-samples/drum-kit/">drum kit</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            I rose to the challenge to refactor a <a href="./code-samples/connect-four/">connect four game</a>. I cannot
            take credit for the original development of the game logic but I did add some of my own ehancements and
            bugfixes to make this a more optimal playing experience and I believe that the codebase is now easier to
            understand and maintain.
        </p>

        <p>
            As part of the assigned reading, I participated in a exercise to download and build a project using parcel
            with npm. This is very familiar territory for me and I have come to appreciate these modern tools that
            automate some of the important optimization tasks associated with development to enable a much improved
            developer experience while making it easy to ship optimized code to users. Lately I've been enjoying the
            speed of builds enabled by <a href="https://esbuild.github.io/">esbuild</a>. It is among a new set of
            competing lighting-fast build tools. These recent developments make the developer experience that much
            better.
