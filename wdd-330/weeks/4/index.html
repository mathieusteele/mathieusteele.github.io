        <p>The reading this week included an instroduction to working with forms and handling form events with
            JavaScript. This included intercepting and preventing form submission and handling focus and blur events.
            See <a href="code-samples/basic-forms/search.html">Basic form events</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            After covering the form basics, we went on to playing with other form controls beside the basic input as
            well as implementing event-based form validation. You can see <a href="code-samples/controls/hero.html">the
                hero form</a> to test it out.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our group meeting was very productive - we built an <a
                href="code-samples/tic-tac-toe/index.html">interactive
                tic-tac-toe board</a> can you win?
