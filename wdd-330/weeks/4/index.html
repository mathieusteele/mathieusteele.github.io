        <p>The reading this week included an instroduction to working with forms and handling form events with
            JavaScript. This included intercepting and preventing form submission and handling focus and blur events.
            See <a href="code-samples/basic-forms/search.html">Basic form events</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            After covering the form basics, we went on to playing with other form controls beside the basic input as
            well as implementing event-based form validation. You can see <a href="code-samples/controls/hero.html">the
                hero form</a> to test it out. Later in the week I engaged in <a href="code-samples/form-validation">more
                form validation practice</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our group meeting was very productive - we built an <a href="code-samples/tic-tac-toe/">interactive
                tic-tac-toe board</a> can you win? See what happens when you try to break it. Many edge cases are
            handled.
        </p>

        <p>Later readings covered object-oriented programming and the modularization of javascript code and how to use
            3rd-party code in projects. The concept of bundlers was introduced with webpack as an example. There are
            trade-offs with using libraries and care should be taken when evaluating them as part of a project solution.
            Why reinvent the wheel when the community has put in the work to solve low-level common problems? Many of
            these open-source libraries are battle-tested with a large community of users and tests to ensure that
            edge-cases are properly handled. There are also benefits to writing custom solutions by oneself, as you
            can individually test your use-case and are not dependent on the maintainer's decision of whether or not to
            support your use-case.</p>
