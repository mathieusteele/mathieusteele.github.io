membership level selection that displays the annual fees (only one option is allowed)
There are four options: Non-profit ($100), Bronze ($200), Silver ($400), Gold ($1000)
The different levels have different perks which you can explain on the page in a key. Things like directory listings, business trainings, social media posts, luncheon tickets, sponsorships with levels of advertising, etc.
