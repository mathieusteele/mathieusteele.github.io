- local company advertisement section highlighting three local companies,
- a call to action to join the chamber leading to a membership application,
- a description of the purpose of the chamber and its goals,
  contact information,
- social media links (at least two and it is OK if they are not linked to a real account),
- the current weather information, obtained from the One Call API at openweathermap.org (Links to an external site.). (Note that you must use this particular API and not the ones used with the weather site project) and include the following:

- display and label a three day forecast of the "day" temperature using the current date.

membership level selection that displays the annual fees (only one option is allowed)
There are four options: Non-profit ($100), Bronze ($200), Silver ($400), Gold ($1000)
The different levels have different perks which you can explain on the page in a key. Things like directory listings, business trainings, social media posts, luncheon tickets, sponsorships with levels of advertising, etc.
