            <h3>Site Purpose</h3>
            <p>There are many reasons why people would visit a local community site. This project aims to showcase local
                cultural and social events, parks and outdoor activities, as well as featuring the five day weather
                forecast for the community members to enjoy. It is helpful to local residents as well as tourists who
                may be visiting the area.</p>
